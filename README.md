# Job Spammers

## About

This repository contains a list of domains for shady, dodgy, moronic, brain-dead, or just plain stupid technical recruiters who spam job postings hoping to collect a placement fee.

Qualifications include but are not limited to:

- Not reading resumes before reaching out with "opportunities" (if my resume doesn't have the word "Windows" in it, why are you trying to recruit me for a Windows job?)
- Using adjectives to indicate some dire need ("Urgent Hiring!" generally means "Need to make my quota")
- "Remote until Covid" - Seriously, what does that even mean?
- Recruiting for positions that aren't in your local area or listed as a relocation area you're open to
- Serious lack of English in their communication (look, I'm just saying maybe having an understanding of the language you're trying to recruit people in would be helpful. Try getting a Duolingo account)
- "Exclusive" or other indications that they are the sole recruiter for the position (no, they're not, they found it on Dice)
- Using an aggregator like Job Diva or Act-On to harvest candidate leads
- Using a domain registered in the past 30 days but claiming to be a "leading placement organization"
- Using stupid greetings like, "Greetings of the day" or "I hope you are doing good"
- Sending a generic email to a BCC list

These recruiters are used car sales people. They'll say whatever they think you want to hear to sign on with them so they can pitch you to a hiring organization and collect a placement fee. They'll claim to be working with the organization but they aren't. They're fly-by-night boiler room shops that are hiring cheap labor to work in a call center. Do everyone a favor and avoid them.

## Using this list

Add the domains in this list to a mail filter in your email client. Send them to spam, trash, /dev/null, whatever. Maybe make a folder specifically for them and drop their mail in there.

At some point there will be an URIBL specifically for these domains that you can add to your email server or SpamAssassin.
